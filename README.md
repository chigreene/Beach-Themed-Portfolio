#Lazy Beach Day

##Description

My website is a portfolio of my current and past projects. It serves a online reference for others to access my work in a fun way. The website was created using only HTML and CSS.

-My motivation two fold. First it was to start from scratch and apply the skills I have learned up to this point in my career. Second I wanted to have a visually appealing online page that I can share with others to showcase my work. 

-Having this webpage solves the problem of being able to share share a consolidated central location of my works with others.

-To complete this project i needed to learn the basics of grids and how to use divs as a link to a web page. I also learned how fun CSS is when designing a webpage.

## Usage

This project is used to access all the deployed projects I have worked. These are intended to be used by an employer to see my capabilities and to show case my creativity and coding abilities. 

Here is a link to the webpage.
